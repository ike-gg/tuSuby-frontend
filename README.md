# tuSuby (Frontend)

## 👉 [Check demo](https://ike-gg.github.io/tuSuby-frontend/)

A website project that offered cheaper subs on twitch.
This project handles 📄 the website, 💳 payments and discord 🤖 bot & 👥 server.

Service similar to [tanieSuby](https://github.com/ike-gg/tanieSuby) with the difference that tuSuby were fully automated! (subs were given by a bot- which I wrote myself- [subgift bot](https://github.com/ike-gg/tuSuby-giftBot).

**Unfortunately, due to changes in the payment processor on twitch, the existence of the service is no longer profitable.**

❗ This is one of my first projects, publishing now because the service has been closed.
